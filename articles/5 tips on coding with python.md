  I have always wondered how we can use Python and get better at it. So I have Made a list of 5 Tips on Coding with Python.

### Tip 1 Use built-in functions and libraries:

This will help you with what ever project you are working on. Plus These features are already optimized for performance.

### Tip 2 Use list comprehensions:

This can make code more beautiful and Pythonic, but it can also make it hard to understand, so it’s best to avoid using them in complex cases.

### Tip 3 Avoid global variables:

While they can have benefits, they can also lead to unexpected side effects, such as complex code structures and decreased performance.

### Tip 4 Use print statements:

These can help you identify problems by showing the program’s execution flow and variable values.

And finally,

### Tip 5 Use a linter:

This tool can check your code for syntax errors and potential bugs.

And there you go,

These are the 5 Tips on Coding with Python

See you next time,

Bye
