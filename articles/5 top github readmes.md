He has a lot of stuff on his GitHub Profile. However what makes it cool is the fact that he has a Table for his Github Stats and A Snake Eating His Contribution Graph
(I Highly don't recommend using that.), He also has a Table of his most Popular Dev.to Blogs, His Skills, Gifs, A short Bio and, A Banner.

### Number 4: Praduma Saraf

His Github Profile is Way Shorter that Anmol's but He does have A Achievements Tab, His Latest Hashnode Blog Post, A Twitter Badge, Short Bio, and Banner.

### Number 3: Rishi Chitnis
